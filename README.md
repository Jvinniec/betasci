## Personal Projects
Here I've listed personal projects that I've worked on.

### Python Projects
The following list of projects make extensive use of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes, and matplotlib visualizations. In the case that a machine-learning or deep learning framework was used, the associated algorithm is identified with a link to the project.

| Name                   | [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) | [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) | Description |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| [Measuring fuel economy](https://github.com/Jvinniec/fuel_economy) | random forest | TensorFlow | Assessing the fuel efficiency of my personal vehicle from 2013 through the beginning of 2017. |
| Titanic survival probability | [random forest](https://www.kaggle.com/jcardenzana/titanic-scikit-learn-random-forest) | [PyTorch](https://www.kaggle.com/jcardenzana/titanic-pytorch)/ [TensorFlow](https://www.kaggle.com/jcardenzana/titanic-tensorflow/notebook) | ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)) Uses machine learning for predicting survivability of passengers on the Titanic | 

### C++ Projects

| Name                   | Description

| [AoE2 AiScript](https://github.com/Jvinniec/aoe2-aiscript) | Visual Studio Code extension to help in writing AI scripts for the Age of Empires 2 video game

### Tableau Projects

[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) is a useful free tool for visualizing data and generating interactive storyboards from data. Here are some of the visualizations I've worked on using this tool. You can also view my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jvcardenzana#!/) to see all of my visualizations.

| Name                   | Description
|------------------------|-------------
| [Guild Wars 2 Trading Post Query](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/guildwars2_buy_sell) | A web data connector that pulls data from the Guild Wars 2 commerce and items APIs and JOINs the results into a Tableau data source.
| [Satellite positions](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/active_satellites/) | Satellites based on their distance from the Earth. Also includes several interesting satellite groups.
| [Exoplanets by Observatory & Method](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/exoplanets) | A dashboard containing a sky map of all currently known exoplanets with selectors based on observatory and detection method.
| Measuring Fuel Economy | A visualization showcasing the data I used in my [Measuring fuel economy](https://github.com/Jvinniec/fuel_economy) Python project.

## Professional Projects
During graduate school and my first Postdoc I worked on several projects as the lead developer and some as a contributing developer. Some of these projects are restricted to members of the collaboration they were developed for, so in those cases I've only posted a link to a paper or presentation about them. Here are some of those projects:

| Name                   | Lead Dev. | Prog. Languages | Description
|------------------------|:---------:|-----------------|-------------
| [VERITAS 3DMLM](https://pos.sissa.it/236/1031/pdf) | X | C++ | Analysis tools for detecting and characterizing astrophysical, gamma-ray sources in data from the VERITAS observatory
| [CTA Survey Tools](https://catalogue-gems.sciencesconf.org/215179/document) | X | C++, Python | Analysis pipeline for blindly searching and fitting sources in the planned CTA Galactic plane survey
| [GammaLib](https://github.com/gammalib/gammalib) | | C++, Python| Analysis framework for gamma-ray astrophysics data
