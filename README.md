## Personal Projects
Here I've listed personal projects that I've worked on.

### Algorithms
A collection of various algorithms in Python and C++ that I've put together can be accessed in the following repository: 
* [Algorithms](https://github.com/Jvinniec/algorithms)

### Python Projects
The following list of projects make extensive use of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes, and matplotlib visualizations. In the case that a machine-learning or deep learning framework was used, the associated algorithm is identified with a link to the project.

| Name                   | [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) | [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)/ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) | Description |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| [Measuring fuel economy](https://github.com/Jvinniec/fuel_economy) | random forest | TensorFlow | Assessing the fuel efficiency of my personal vehicle from 2013 through the beginning of 2017. |
| [Historical Stock Data](https://github.com/Jvinniec/di-milestoneproj) | | | Simple webapp for fetching & displaying stock data for a user supplied symbol that uses *Flask*. |
| [Kaggle](kaggle/) | | | Various projects involving [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions and kernels. |

### C++ Projects

| Name                   | Description
|------------------------|-------------
| [CppEphem](https://github.com/Jvinniec/CppEphem) | A self contained ephemeris package for computing celestial coordinates using the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy library
| [Lutz One Pass](https://github.com/Jvinniec/lutz_one_pass) | An implementation of the [Lutz One Pass algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/23.3.262), an algorithm for extracting information from an image in a single pass over that image.

*Additional C++ projects in the [professional projects](#professional-projects) section.*

### Javascript/Typescript Projects

### Tableau Projects

[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) is a useful free tool for visualizing data and generating interactive storyboards from data. Here are some of the visualizations I've worked on using this tool. You can also view my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jvcardenzana#!/) to see all of my visualizations.

| Name                   | Description
|------------------------|-------------
| [Makeover Monday](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/MakeoverMonday/) | The visualizations I've put together for the Makeover Monday initiative.
| [Child Poverty in America](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/child_poverty_rate/) | A visualization showing the child poverty rate in America over three time epochs.
| [Guild Wars 2 Trading Post Query](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/guildwars2_buy_sell) | A web data connector that pulls data from the Guild Wars 2 commerce and items APIs and JOINs the results into a Tableau data source.
| [Satellite positions](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/active_satellites/) | Satellites based on their distance from the Earth. Also includes several interesting satellite groups.
| [Exoplanets by Observatory & Method](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/exoplanets) | A dashboard containing a sky map of all currently known exoplanets with selectors based on observatory and detection method.
| Measuring Fuel Economy | A visualization showcasing the data I used in my [Measuring fuel economy](https://github.com/Jvinniec/fuel_economy) Python project.

## Professional Projects
During graduate school and my first Postdoc I worked on several projects as the lead developer and some as a contributing developer. Some of these projects are restricted to members of the collaboration they were developed for, so in those cases I've only posted a link to a paper or presentation about them. Here are some of those projects:

| Name                   | Lead Developer | Prog. Languages | Description
|------------------------|:--------------:|:---------------:|-------------
| [VERITAS 3DMLM](https://pos.sissa.it/236/1031/pdf) | X | C++ | Analysis tools for detecting and characterizing astrophysical, gamma-ray sources in data from the VERITAS observatory
| [CTA Survey Tools](https://catalogue-gems.sciencesconf.org/215179/document) | X | C++, Python | Analysis pipeline for blindly searching and fitting sources in the planned CTA Galactic plane survey
| [GammaLib](https://github.com/gammalib/gammalib) | | C++, Python| Analysis framework for gamma-ray astrophysics data
| [*ctools*](https://github.com/ctools/ctools) | | C++, Python | Analysis tools for analyzing data from the CTA observatory

## Continued Education
I am a firm believer that learning is something we should never stop doing. Here are a list of online courses I've taken to expand my knowledge and skills.
