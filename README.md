### Tableau Projects

[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) is a useful free tool for visualizing data and generating interactive storyboards from data. Here are some of the visualizations I've worked on using this tool. You can also view my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jvcardenzana#!/) to see all of my visualizations.

|------------------------|-------------
| [Satellite positions](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/active_satellites/) | Satellites based on their distance from the Earth. Also includes several interesting satellite groups.
| [Exoplanets by Observatory & Method](https://github.com/Jvinniec/tableau_projects/tree/master/exoplanets) | A dashboard containing a sky map of all currently known exoplanets with selectors based on observatory and detection method.
| Measuring Fuel Economy | A visualization showcasing the data I used in my [Measuring fuel economy](https://github.com/Jvinniec/fuel_economy) Python project.

## Professional Projects
During graduate school and my first Postdoc I worked on several projects as the lead developer and some as a contributing developer. Some of these projects are restricted to members of the collaboration they were developed for, so in those cases I've only posted a link to a paper or presentation about them. Here are some of those projects:

| Name                   | Lead Dev. | Prog. Languages | Description

| [CTA Survey Tools](https://catalogue-gems.sciencesconf.org/215179/document) | X | C++, Python | Analysis pipeline for blindly searching and fitting sources in the planned CTA Galactic plane survey
| [GammaLib](https://github.com/gammalib/gammalib) | | C++, Python| Analysis framework for gamma-ray astrophysics data
| [*ctools*](https://github.com/ctools/ctools) | | C++, Python | Analysis tools for analyzing data from the CTA observatory
